## Hi there! Welcome to the Upper Pupper description!

For context on the name, see the following: http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sleep-tight-pupper

Upper Pupper is a project inspired by the "FaceMash" concept, popularized by inventor of Facebook and notably shown in the movie "The Social Network."

The Upper Pupper project uses user input to compare an array of doggos (Doggo: https://www.google.com/search?q=doggo&safe=off&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiB8M3W0rbNAhXEKh4KHW_9CIkQ_AUICCgB&biw=1920&bih=1075) against one another.

Through the usage of an ELO system, ratings are modulated by user input. 

Ratings are then averaged across the breed in an effort to definitively determine which breed of doggo is cutest!

To get started, open index.html. 

The most relevant files are labs.js and index.html respectively.

Happy updooting!
